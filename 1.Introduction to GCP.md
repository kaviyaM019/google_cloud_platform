What is Cloud Computing? (Thanglish Explanation)

Cloud computing-na internet mooliyama servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and AI maadhiri computing services-a provide panradhu. Idhunaala faster innovation, flexible resources, and cost-saving advantages kedaikum.

Public cloud, private cloud, and physical cloud maadhiri different types irukku.

Public Cloud: Multiple users share panra environment.

Private Cloud: Single organization use panna secure environment.

Physical Cloud: Physical servers manage panna vendiyadhu.

Cloud computing-a use panna business scalability and efficiency improve aagum.


1)2. cloud of Iot?

An Iot system consists of sensor /devices which talk to the cloud through some kind of connectivity .once the data gets to the cloud software processes it and then might decide to perform an actio such as sending an alert or automatically adjusting the sensordevices without the need for the user.

(in thanglish)

Oru IoT system-la sensors illa devices irukum. Itha cloud oda connect panna some kind of connectivity (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular network) use pannuvanga. Sensors collect panna data cloud ku anupum.

Cloud-la irukura software and data processing algorithms andha data ah analyze pannum. Analyze panna piragu, software decide pannum enna action edukkanum nu. For example:

Oru alert anupalam (like notification or message)

Sensors or devices ah automatically adjust pannalam (like turning off a device or increasing temperature)

Intha process la user intervention illama, automation la nadakkum. Ithu IoT system oda core working concept.



1)3. cloud for Ml


Machine learning ia an approcag and set of technologies that use AI concepts ,is directly related to pattern recognition and computational learning .The cloud makes it easy for enterprises to experiment with machine learning capabilities and scale up as projects go into production and demand increses.

(in thanglish)  

Machine learning (ML) nu oru approach um set of technologies um iruku, idhu AI (Artificial Intelligence) concepts use pannitu work pannum. ML mainly pattern recognition um computational learning um related ah irukum.

Cloud use pannina, enterprises (companies) ku machine learning capabilities ah easy ah experiment pannurathu possible. Projects production stage ku pona piragu, demand increase aagumbothu, cloud la easy ah scale up pannalam. Ithu flexibility um cost-effectiveness um kudukum.


1)4. Disaster recovery


Any downtime or loss of data can result in lost revenue,lose customer,poor productivity ,penalties or litigation, and damage to your brand reputation.

diaster recovery service framework is designed to meet the demand of enterprises to bring resiliency to business to business models delivering uninterrupted services.
(in thanglish)

Any downtime illa data loss nadandha, adhu revenue loss (panam nashtam), customers lose pannuradhu, poor productivity (seyalaala thadai), penalties illa litigation (dhandanai illa case), mattrum brand reputation damage (pazhakkam kedukiradhu) nu result aagum.

Disaster Recovery Service Framework enterprises oda demand ah meet panna design pannirukku. Ithu business to business (B2B) models ku resiliency (mudhalilai thirumba serkiradhu) provide panni, uninterrupted services (thodarndha sevai) deliver panna help pannum.


2.1).What is GCp?

![alt text](image2.png)

(in thanglish)
GCP stands for Google Cloud Platform. Ithu Google provide panra oru cloud computing service suite. Google search, Gmail, YouTube madhiri Google end-user products ku use pandra infrastructure thaane, atha external users ku kooda provide panraanga.

Adha use panni companies and developers, applications host pannalam, data store pannalam, AI models train pannalam, network manage pannalam. Intha platform la multiple services irukku like storage, computing, databases, and machine learning tools.


why Gcp

*cost effetive
*highly scalable
*customer machine types
*internet of things
*api platform and *ecosystem
*big data analytics
*cloud ai
*servreless



advatages of GCP

1.higher uptime and reliability

* The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data ,they are able to independently adapt.They learn from previous computations to produce reliable ,repeatable decision and results.


2.Economic pricing 

* The iterative aspects of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they are able to independently addapt. They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decision and results.

3.higher security
